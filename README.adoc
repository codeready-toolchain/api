== Building
Requires:

* Go version 1.23.x (1.23.12 or higher) - download for your development environment https://golang.org/dl/[here].

CodeReady ToolChain API is built using https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules[Go modules].

To re-generate the `zz_generated.deepcopy.go` and `zz_generated.openapi.go` files as well as the CRD files, run the following command:

```sh
make generate
```

NOTE: the `make generate` will generate the CRD files in the local `config/crd/bases` directory and then dispatch the `.yaml` files in the `host-operator` and `member-operator` repositories, assuming they have been checked out and that *they are in a clean state*, meaning that they have no pending changes, besides previous versions of the CRD files.

NOTE: Then you are supposed to create PRs also in the repos where the change was propagated ( host | member-operator ). Please do not mix other changes to the code with those CRD changes. While it would work technically , itâ€™s always preferred to promote the CRD changes separately for easier PR review.
