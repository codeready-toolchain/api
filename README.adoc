== Building
Requires:

* Go version 1.20.x (1.20.11 or higher) - download for your development environment https://golang.org/dl/[here].
* Operator SDK v1.25.0 - download for your development environment https://v1-25-x.sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/#install-from-github-release[here]

CodeReady ToolChain API is built using https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules[Go modules].

To re-generate the `zz_generated.deepcopy.go` and `zz_generated.openapi.go` files as well as the CRD files, run the following command:

```sh
make generate
```

IMPORTANT: the codeready-toolchain repositories should be checked out under your GOPATH in order for the generation to generate files in the correct directories. eg. For this repository: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/codeready-toolchain/api`
NOTE: the `make generate` will generate the CRD files in the local `deploy/crds` directory and then dispatch the `.yaml` files in the `host-operator` and `member-operator` repositories, assuming they have been checked out and that *they are in a clean state*, meaning that they have no pending changes, besides previous versions of the CRD files.
